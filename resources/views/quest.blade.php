            The quest has a body of text that needs to be displayed somewhere.
            Usually one or two paragraphs long at most.
            <br><br>
            The quest needs to display a reward somewhere. A graphical representation
            of the reward would feel more exciting than simple text. The reward will
            usually be something like "1000 coins", but eventually I'd like to also
            offer items/weapons/armors as rewards too.
            <br><br>
            Finally, a button link back to their previous page needs to be displayed.
